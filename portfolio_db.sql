The task involves utilizing Cinema 4D software to construct a personalized arena showcase and capturing an exhilarating video for it.', 'The process of choosing a theme can be quite a dilemma, but once the theme is established, everything progresses smoothly. This is also a very interesting part because electronic games often offer more imaginative possibilities than real-world competitive sports.\r\nAfter receiving the task requirements, what came to my mind was not just a grand and expansive scene with intricate structures and scattered lights but the content of the video. This implies that the arena must have an engaging theme.\r\nAfter receiving assistance from the professor, I confirmed my idea to create content with a competitive nature. While many people choose sports similar to instructional videos—competitive sports being a great option—I first thought of the competitive game I enjoy, World of Warcraft.', 'As a widely popular online game that has been around for many years, its resources are abundant. However, the distinctive art design and the vast, expansive game background posed challenges for this task.\r\n\r\nThe logos of both factions are overly complex. It\'s challenging to determine the timing of key events in the promotional video. Artistic requirements for lighting and material textures pose difficulties in this task.\r\n\r\nEspecially concerning the issue of material textures, it\'s crucial to strike a balance between realism and the virtual scale. The lighting should not be too dim, yet excessive brightness might compromise its distinctive features.', 'After repeatedly examining the game textures and content, I had a research direction, particularly studying some scenes that professionals recreated using Unreal Engine 5. The stunning realism achieved through Unreal\'s reset effect provided excellent affirmation and inspiration for my ideas.', '1.Insufficient understanding of material textures.\r\n\r\n2.Adequate preparation and research are necessary before initiating the object creation process to ensure a well- thought-out approach at each step.\r\n\r\n3.Perfect handling of lighting is essential; different lighting setups can create drastically different effects for the same object.'),
(2, 'pf02.png', 'Elin', 'In this project, we embarked on an exciting journey to redefine the essence of beauty products with Elin Cosmetics. Our goal was to create a line of makeup that not only enhances natural beauty but also adheres to the principles of sustainability and ethical sourcing.

To tackle this, we focused on unique selling propositions such as organic ingredients, cruelty-free testing, and eco-friendly packaging. Another challenge was ensuring supply chain transparency. We partnered with verified suppliers and implemented rigorous quality checks to maintain product integrity.', 'The launch of Elin Cosmetics was a resounding success. The brand was well-received for its commitment to sustainability and quality. Sales exceeded projections by 30% in the first quarter, and the feedback from customers has been overwhelmingly positive. The project has set a new benchmark in the beauty industry for combining luxury with responsibility.', 'The Elin Cosmetics project was not just a venture into beauty products, but a deep dive into the ethos of modern consumerism.
